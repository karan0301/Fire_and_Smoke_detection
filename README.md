# Fire_and_Smoke_detection
Real-time Fire &amp; Smoke Detection System using YOLOv8 and live video feed. Built using Python and OpenCV to identify fire or smoke in video frames with high accuracy and low latency. Ideal for AI safety projects and smart surveillance systems.

# 🔥 Fire & Smoke Detection System using YOLOv8

A real-time fire and smoke detection system using **YOLOv8** and **live video feed processing**. This project is built with **Python** and **OpenCV**, leveraging the power of deep learning to detect potential fire or smoke hazards from video frames.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system analyzes live video footage frame-by-frame using a YOLOv8 model trained to detect fire and smoke. It's a local setup (no cloud dependency) ideal for environments like:

- Smart homes
- Offices or factories
- Forest surveillance
- Safety monitoring in public spaces

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time object detection (Fire, Smoke)
- 📹 Live video stream capture and analysis
- ⚠️ Potential to trigger alert systems (buzzer, SMS, etc.)
- ⚡ Lightweight, fast, and local execution
- 💡 Extendable to other safety-critical applications

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics)
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**

---

## 🖼️ Sample Output

> Coming soon... *(Add demo video or images of detection here)*

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the YOLOv8 model
2. Capture frames from a live video feed (webcam or other camera)
3. Run detection on each frame
4. Highlight detected fire or smoke with bounding boxes
5. Optionally trigger alerts or log results
